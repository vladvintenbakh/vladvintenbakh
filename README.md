## Hi GitHub 👋

I am a passionate data analyst with over 5 years of experience transforming complex datasets into actionable business insights 📊

I specialise in Python for data cleaning, wrangling, and visualisation - leveraging tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib 💻

I also learn programming languages as a hobby. So far, I have explored Swift, C, Java, JavaScript, and OCaml 📚

When I am not at my laptop, you will likely find me playing football ⚽️ or FIFA 🎮
