## Hi GitHub 👋

I mostly use this space as my Data Engineering playground.

Here are some projects I have been working on to sharpen my DE skills:
- 🔄 ETL
  - [Sales Mart Pipeline](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/SalesMartPipeline) (Airflow, PostgreSQL, star schema)
- 💧 Data Lake
  - [Social Network Geo-Analytics & Data Lake](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/SocialNetworkDataLake) (PySpark, HDFS, Airflow)
- ⚡️ Streaming
  - [Restaurant Promotion Streaming Service](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/RestaurantPromotionStreamingService) (PySpark, Kafka, PostgreSQL)
- ☁️ Cloud
  - [Restaurant Order Processing Pipeline](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/CloudVaultPipeline) (Yandex Cloud, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes)

📱 Bonus: As a hobby, I collaborated with a couple of friends on [NFT Marketplace App](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/NFTMarketplaceApp) for iOS.
